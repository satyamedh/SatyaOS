# SatyaOS

This is an operating system kernel based on [this](https://wiki.osdev.org/Meaty_Skeleton) guide

This OS is just for fun and for me to learn assembly and freestanding C. this isnt meant to be used at all!
I would love it for somebody to add stuff to this Project of mine, so I can learn more :)

## Todo
 - scanf implementation
 - cmakelists.txt with the proper stdio etc

I will gladly accept any PRs!
